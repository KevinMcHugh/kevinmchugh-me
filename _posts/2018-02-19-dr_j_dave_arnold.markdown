This is a recipe from [Dave Arnold's](https://twitter.com/@CookingIssues) Booker and Dax. One recipe, appropriate for restaurant service, is described in his *Liquid Intelligence*. This recipe is more appropriate for home service. The published recipe calls for milk-washing the white-rum. This works well if you're making a lot within a few days. The proteins in the milk will add foaming power to the rum, but that diminishes after a couple days. Using milk syrup, which keeps for weeks without losing its foaming power, means this preparation is much better suited for home bartenders.

Arnold described this recipe on [Episode 319 of Cooking Issues](http://heritageradionetwork.org/podcast/hookered-up-drinks/) and I've put it here for my own convenience.

<h3> Milk Syrup </h3>
* 500ml whole milk
* 500g sugar

Blend until sugar is dissolved.

Add 1.25oz 15% citric acid solution. (fluid ounces, I think. Arnold usually doesn't typically measure weights in oz)
Stir. Syrup will thicken.

<h3> Lime-strength Orange Juice</h3>
* 1 liter fresh-squeezed orange juice
* 32 grams citric acid
* 20 grams malic acid

Combine and stir.

<h3> Dr. J </h3>
* 2 ounces white rum
* 3/4 ounce lime-strength orange juice
* flat 3/4 ounce milk syrup
* drop vanilla extract
* drop saline solution

Shake and serve in a coupe glass.

Look at that foam!

I've tried Bacardi and Denizen and they both smell like rubbing alcohol. It's not overpowering or prominent in the drink, but it's unfortunate.

Botran white rum works beautifully here. It's the only one of the three I've tried that isn't unpleasantly obvious.
