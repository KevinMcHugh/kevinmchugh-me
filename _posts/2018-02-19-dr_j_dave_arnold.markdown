This is a recipe from [Dave Arnold's](https://twitter.com/@CookingIssues) Booker and Dax. One recipe, appropriate for restaurant service, is described in his *Liquid Intelligence*. This recipe is more appropriate for home service. He described it on [Episode 319 of Cooking Issues](http://heritageradionetwork.org/podcast/hookered-up-drinks/) and I've put it here for my own convenience.

<h3> Milk Syrup </h3>
* 500ml whole milk
* 500g sugar

Blend until sugar is dissolved.

Add 1.25oz 15% citric acid solution. (fluid ounces, I think. Arnold usually doesn't typically measure weights in oz)
Stir. Syrup will thicken.

<h3> Lime-strength Orange Juice</h3>
* 1 liter orange juice
* 32 grams citric acid
* 20 grams malic acid

Combine and stir.

<h3> Dr. J </h3>
* 2 ounces white rum
* 3/4 ounce lime-strength orange juice
* flat 3/4 ounce milk syrup
* drop vanilla extract
* drop saline solution

Shake and serve in a coupe glass. I don't have a coupe glass, so here's what mine looked like:
